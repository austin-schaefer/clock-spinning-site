Clock Spinning is going bananas this week by talking about--you guessed it--bananas! In this episode we rate, review, and ban-analyze every card in Magic that has bananas in the art, flavor text, and even oracle text. We had an ape-solute blast putting this one together, and we hope you enjoy it too!

You can see every card from the episode [here](https://scryfall.com/search?q=ft%3Abanana+or+art%3Abanana+prefer%3Aoldest+-is%3Afunny+-is%3Adigital+-is%3Atoken&unique=cards&as=grid&order=released&dir=asc).
