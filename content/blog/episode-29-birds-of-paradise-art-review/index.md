Carrying our now-storied tradition of art review episodes into its fourth installment, Austin and Connor spend today's episode going deep on Magic's [first](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/608498/ornithological-studies)--and most famous--bird(s): Birds of Paradise!

Our journey will take us from what was [supposed to be an island](https://scryfall.com/card/lea/186/birds-of-paradise) to some egregious WotC [photoshopping](https://scryfall.com/card/8ed/233/birds-of-paradise), and through [Secret Lairs](https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1148/birds-of-paradise) on to [Universes Beyond](https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/235/birds-of-paradise) (much to Austin's chagrin).

Like our other art review episodes, which you can find here, over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning), or in your favorite podcast app, we'll rate and discuss every unique work of art the Birds have ever been blessed with. And if you've already given those a listen, our S through F scale for rating each piece will come as no surprise.

All the birds discussed in today's episode have nested [on this webpage](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%2B%2B+%28e%3Alea+cn%3D186%29+OR+%28e%3A7ed+cn%3D231%29+OR+%28e%3A8ed+cn%3D233%29+OR+%28e%3Arav+cn%3D153%29+OR+%28e%3Apm11+cn%3D165%29+OR+%28e%3Asld+cn%3D92%29+OR+%28e%3Asld+cn%3D1147%29+OR+%28e%3Asld+cn%3A1148%29+OR+%28e%3Admr+cn%3D439%29+OR+%28e%3Altc+cn%3A235%29+order%3Areleased+dir%3Aasc), if you'd like to follow along as we cover each card. Or, just check out the YouTube video at the top of this page, where we'll show each card on your screen as we talk about it. We'd also love for you to check out the other episodes on our [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning), and if you feel so inclined, subscribe and let a friend or two know about the show!
