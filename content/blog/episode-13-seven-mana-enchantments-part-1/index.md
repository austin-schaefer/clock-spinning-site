### Clock Spinning is on YouTube!

If visuals are more your jam, you can now find this and all other episodes [over on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bHYd8E2Y4hJnZiu_4NBqw), where youâ€™ll be able to see each card as we talk about it!

### Seven plus mana, and so many cool cards

On today's episode of Clock Spinning, we're bringing you some of the biggest, baddest (and sometimes actually just bad) cards in the game. We're reviewing and rating every white and blue enchantment that costs [7 or more mana](https://clock-spinning.captivate.fm/7-mana-enchantments-pt-1).

This episode [starts with a bang](https://scryfall.com/card/leg/8/divine-intervention) and might even be a bit [overwhelming](https://scryfall.com/card/hou/19/overwhelming-splendor) at times, but we had a blast with it and certainly [know more than we did](https://scryfall.com/card/m13/63/omniscience) when we started. We hope you enjoy it too!

Of course, we won't leave you hanging by stopping at blue: Today's episode is Part One of a two-part enchantment bonanza, so keep an eye out for Part Two, coming soon!

If you're just tuning in to Clock Spinning, we'd encourage you to check out our Champions of Kamigawa set review series, where we rate every single card in Champions with an eye toward building a cube.

And if you'd like to share any thoughts, cherished memories, or games that ended in a draw to Divine Intervention, we'd love to hear from you!
