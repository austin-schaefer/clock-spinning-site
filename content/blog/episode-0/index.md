Welcome to Episode Zero of Clock Spinning, the podcast where we explore the history of Magic: the Gathering from Onslaught to Time Spiral!

We're Austin and Connor, the hosts of Clock Spinning. We'll talk about Magic's history, share horrifying stories of donut buckets and long fingernails from the prereleases of yesteryear, and give you the most in-depth analysis of [Graxiplon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29714) ever recorded. But we're also here to [build a cube](http://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clockspinning), a hand-picked set of Magic cards to use in limited play. Our aim is to gradually shape the almost 4,000 cards in these sets into a singleton cube that highlights iconic cards, themes, and mechanics from this period of Magic's history.

## The IMPAB system

As we go through all of these cards, we'll be rating each and every one of them using what we have cleverly coined the **IMPAB** system. IMPAB stands for:

- **I**nstacut: These are cards where we can say with confidence that they will not be making it into the cube. Yes, [Chimney Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45985), we're talking about you.
- **M**eh: These cards aren't good, but they're not necessarily awful either. We may revisit these in the future as the cube starts to take shape and we get a sense of where certain mechanics or archetypes are lacking.
- **P**layable: These are cards that are generally playable in many circumstances. This was a ~~weaker~~ different time for the game, so a lot of the cards that we rate as Playable in our set reviews might not look so great by modern standards.
- **A**uto-include: The best of the best (at least in these sets!), Auto-includes are the cards that we know we want to have in the cube. These might be iconic cards that still get a lot of love, cards that define an archetype or showcase an awesome mechanic, or cards that we just plain love.
- **B**uild-around: The most slippery rating. These are cards that could be fun and interesting to play with, but which would need some extra support to make that possible. For example, [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=41148) might be really fun to see in the cube, but would need plenty of cycling cards to make it work.

You can follow along with card ratings over at our [Cube Cobra page](http://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clockspinning), where we'll tag every card we discuss after each episode (except for the instacuts, which will be fed to the [Moss Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1535)).

## Why these cards?

We've chosen to focus on sets from Onslaught block to Time Spiral block for a few reasons. First, this was a time when Magic's designers started to really flex their muscles and push the boundaries of what the game could look like. Onslaught brought us morph and the fetchlands, Mirrodin introduced equipment, Kamigawa brought us... kami? Okay, not *everything* worked, but these were formative years for the modern era of Magic!

Second, these years of Magic introduced players to the idea of worlds beyond Dominaria, the plane in which (most of) Magic's story up to that point had taken place. These sets saw a real opening up of design space in Magic, both mechanically and creatively, and previewed a future where [transforming Eldrazi Vampires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414408) could be free to roam. From the metal world of Mirrodin to the Shinto-inspired plane of Kamigawa, these sets showed us that Magic could expand beyond its high fantasy roots.

Finally, we just have a lot of warm, fuzzy feelings about these cards! Much as it pains us to say it, the cards we'll talk about on Clock Spinning are older now than cards in Alpha were when we started playing the game. If you share those warm, fuzzy feelings, or if you just share our love for Magic, check out the show on any platform where you get your podcasts!
