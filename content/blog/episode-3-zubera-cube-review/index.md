This week, we're taking a brief break from our Champions of Kamigawa set reviews to bring you a short(er) episode on some of Connor's favorite cards in the set -- the Zuberas! If you want to learn how to set up a one-turn-kill combo involving these frightening spirit friends, or if you just share our love for the handful of cards in Magic's history to carry the great honor of the Zubera creature type, check out Episode 3 now, where we'll also be sharing some of the great comments and feedback we've received from our listeners.

As always, we've updated our [Kamigawa Block Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk) over on Cube Cobra with our IMPAB ratings for all of the Zuberas. Feel free to take the cube for a test drive, and let us know if you pull off that OTK!

If you're just joining us here at [Clock Spinning](https://clockspinning.com/about), you may want to start at [Episode 1](https://clockspinning.com/episode-1-white-champions-of-kamigawa/), where we rated all 50 white cards in Champions according to our IMPAB system. We continued that journey in [Episode 2](https://clockspinning.com/episode-2-blue-champions-of-kamigawa/) by looking at the set's blue cards.

Next week, we'll be back on the set review grind to look at the black cards of Champions of Kamigawa! We can't wait to dive into what might be the strongest color in this set, and we would love to hear from you if you have any thoughts, memories, or insights to share about these creepy cards. You can find a list of all 50 black cards in Champions [here](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=color%3DB+set%3Achk), so take a look and send us an email at clock[dot]spinning[dot]podcast[at]gmail[dot].com.
