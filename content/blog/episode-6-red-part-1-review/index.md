In this week's episode of Clock Spinning, we're bringing you Part 1 of our two-part review of every red card in Champions of Kamigawa, from [Akki Avalanchers](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/151/akki-avalanchers) (and plenty of other Akki) to the man, the myth, the legend, [Kiki-Jiki](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/175/kiki-jiki-mirror-breaker). Along the way, we'll see more four-mana 1/1s than any one set should have, plenty of spicy art commentary, and some [truly painful](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/162/crushing-pain) cards.

You can follow along as we build our [Kamigawa Block Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk) over on Cube Cobra. We update the cube after each episode with all of our IMPAB ratings and cuts. If you'd like to really dive in deep, you can take the cube for a spin and playtest it [here](https://cubecobra.com/cube/playtest/clock-spinning-chk).

Next week, we'll continue looking at red, for better or worse. (In Kamigawa red, it's probably worse) We'd love to hear any thoughts, insights, or memories you'd like to share with us about the red cards of Kamigawa, or any other cards in the block, so send us an email at clock [dot] spinning [dot] podcast [at] gmail [dot] com.
