In this totally unique and not-at-all-requested episode of Clock Spinning, we're looking at one of Onslaught's strangest creatures: [Graxiplon](https://scryfall.com/card/ons/86/graxiplon). That's right--this episode is about **just one card**! (and maybe some [Mon Calamari](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari))

Join us as we dissect one of Connor's favorite cards from childhood in what we'll venture is the most detailed piece of content ever created about Graxiplon. Is it a sliver? A [cephalid experiment gone wrong](https://scryfall.com/card/ons/309/riptide-replicator)? Tune in to find out!

You can see all the cards discussed in this episode [here](https://scryfall.com/card/ons/86/graxiplon). (I bet you clicked it!)

Or, to see the one card covered in this surprisingly long episode, just check out the YouTube video at the top of this page! We'd also love for you to check out our [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning), where you can find every one of our past episodes (art reviews and otherwise).

Tune in next time as we return to Kamigawa (the old one!) to rate and review some other creatures with [too many limbs](https://scryfall.com/card/bok/141/sakiko-mother-of-summer)!
