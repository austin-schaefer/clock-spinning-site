This week on Clock Spinning, we're back with another art-by-art review of every unique printing of one of Magic's most iconic cards! We had a great time marveling at the [art of Counterspell](https://youtu.be/899KkVCpekM), and we're excited to continue that one-episode tradition with a true legend: Dark Ritual.

The art of Dark Ritual covers all the bases, from [macabre](https://scryfall.com/card/usg/127/dark-ritual) to [derpy](https://scryfall.com/card/ice/120/dark-ritual), [baffling](https://scryfall.com/card/g09/1/dark-ritual) to [haunting](https://scryfall.com/card/sta/89/ja/%E6%9A%97%E9%BB%92%E3%81%AE%E5%84%80%E5%BC%8F). Dark Ritual has even had its cardboard graced by [not one](https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/129/dark-ritual) but **two** of the [great fantasy artists of the age](https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1170/dark-ritual)!

If you're just tuning in, this is part of a mini-series we're trying where we rate every piece of art ever printed on the cards that have received the most artistically unique reprints.

You can see all the cards discussed in this episode [here](https://scryfall.com/search?q=dark+ritual+unique%3Aart+prefer%3Aoldest&unique=cards&order=released&dir=asc) (SPOILER: they all do the same thing), or for an even better experience, see each one as we discuss it in the YouTube video at the top of this page. We'd love for you to also check out our [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning), where you can also find every one of our past episodes, with each card magically appearing on your screen as we discuss it!

We love hearing from listeners, so if you have a favorite Dark Ritual or a card or theme you'd like to see on the show, reach out!
