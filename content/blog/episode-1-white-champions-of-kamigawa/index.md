In our inaugural episode of Clock Spinning, we kick off the first of many set reviews by looking at the 50 white cards of Champions of Kamigawa (CHK)! We'll be using our **IMPAB** system to rate all of these cards, with the goal of deciding which ones should ascend to the spirit realm and which ones need to stay among the mortals.

As you'll hear at the beginning of the show, IMPAB stands for:

- Insta-cut
- Meh
- Playable
- Auto-include
- Build-around

As we discuss each card in Champions and beyond, we'll give it one of these five ratings. If we think that we might want more than one copy of a card in the cube, we'll discuss that too.

For this and every set review episode, we'll share a post like this one to provide a handy list of all the cards we cover in the episode. If you'd like an *even more* interactive experience with cards like [Candles' Glow](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/5/candles-glow)  and [Sensei Golden-Tail](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/44/sensei-golden-tail), please check out our [Kamigawa Block Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk) over on Cube Cobra, where we'll be tagging each and every card with its IMPAB rating after each episode. If you give it a test draft, let us know so we can shout you out on the show!

Without further ado, the white cards of Champions of Kamigawa!
