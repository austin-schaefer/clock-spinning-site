In our inaugural episode of Clock Spinning, we kick off the first of many set reviews by looking at the 61 white cards of Onslaught (ONS)! We'll be using our **IMPAB** system to rate all 61 cards, with the goal of deciding which ones should make the cut for our cube and which ones need to stay in Dominaria.

If you have no idea what IMPAB means, we forgive you (this time). IMPAB stands for:

- Insta-cut
- Meh
- Playable
- Auto-include
- Build-around

As we discuss each card in Onslaught and beyond, we'll give it one of these five ratings. You can find more information about IMPAB—and about the show itself—in [**Episode Zero**](/episode-0/) of Clock Spinning, available wherever you listen to podcasts.

For this and every set review episode, we'll share a post like this one to provide a handy list of all the cards we cover in the episode. If you'd like an *even more* interactive experience with cards like Aurification and Aven Brigadier, please check out the [Clock Spinning Cube](http://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clockspinning) over on Cube Cobra, where we'll be tagging each and every card with its IMPAB rating after each episode.

Without further ado, the white cards of Onslaught!
