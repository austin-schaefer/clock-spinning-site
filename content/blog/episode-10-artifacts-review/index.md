## 010: Reviewing the Artifacts of Champions of Kamigawa for cube

In today's episode, Clock Spinning hits the double digits *and* finishes the non-land cards of Champions of Kamigawa! CHK's twenty-two artifacts (all of them uncommon or rare!) paid the price for the wildly broken artifacts of Mirrodin, the block that came before Kamigawa. We'll talk about some [true icons](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/268/senseis-divining-top), [awesome swords](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/270/tatsumasa-the-dragons-fang) from the early days of Equipment in Magic, and some real [head-scratchers](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/269/shell-of-the-last-kappa).

In case you're just tuning in to the show, our goal with this card-by-card review of CHK is to build a cube that captures the essence of this unique and strange set. Along the way, we explore the art, flavor, and history behind the cards. Every card we talk about is rated according to our IMPAB rating system, which stands for:

 - Insta-cut
 - Meh
 - Playable
 - Auto-include
 - Build-around

You can check out our [Kamigawa Block Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk) over on Cube Cobra, which we update with our card ratings and cuts after each episode. You can also try [playtesting it](https://cubecobra.com/cube/playtest/clock-spinning-chk) if you want a more hands-on experience with Clock Spinning.

In our next and final episode on Champions of Kamigawa, we'll review the lands of CHK and finally discuss the mana base for the cube. (Hint: It's not just Kamigawa lands)

If you have any thoughts to share about that mana base, the cube, or Kamigawa in general, you can reach us by email at clockspinningpodcast@gmail.com, or find us over on the [MagicTCG](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/) and [MTGCube](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/) subreddits.

If you know someone who might enjoy the show, please let them know about us! We'd love to reach more fans of Kamigawa, cube, and just chatting about Magic cards.
