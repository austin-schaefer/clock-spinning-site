We're very excited to bring you another episode in our card-by-card set review of Champions of Kamigawa! In [Episode 1](https://clockspinning.com/episode-1-white-champions-of-kamigawa/), we rated all 50 white cards in Champions according to our **IMPAB** system. In today's episode, we're moving on to blue. Come along for our visit to [Minamo](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Minamo), draw more cards than you'll know what to do with, and dare to listen to us speak about [The Unspeakable](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/98/the-unspeakable)!

As a reminder, IMPAB stands for:

- Insta-cut
- Meh
- Playable
- Auto-include
- Build-around

As we discuss each card in Champions and beyond, we'll give it one of these five ratings. If we think that we might want more than one copy of a card in the cube, we'll discuss that too.

If you think you might want to try being [Lifted by Clouds](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/73/lifted-by-clouds) or you'd like to hang out with our dear friend [River Kaijin](https://scryfall.com/card/chk/83/river-kaijin), please check out our [Kamigawa Block Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk) over on Cube Cobra, where we'll be tagging every card with its IMPAB rating after each episode. Feel free to take the cube for a test draft and give it a follow if you like what you hear on today's episode!

Without further ado, the blue cards of Champions of Kamigawa!
