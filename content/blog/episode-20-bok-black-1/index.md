Today's episode of Clock Spinning brings us back into the swamps of Takenuma, where we're rating and reviewing the first half of Betrayers of Kamigawa's black cards. Come along for the ride as we encounter some of the most [baffingly bad removal](https://scryfall.com/card/bok/63/call-for-blood) we've seen yet, serve our oni masters with [Ink-Eyes](https://scryfall.com/card/bok/71/ink-eyes-servant-of-oni), and discover Austin's [leech limit](https://scryfall.com/card/bok/62/blessing-of-leeches) (it's ten feet). We have a lot to say about the art on this episode's cards too, so we'd encourage you to check out this episode in particular on our [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning), where we put up every card's image as we go.

After Clock Spinning's recent [vacation in Phyrexia](https://clockspinning.com/episode-19-magics-oldest-phyrexians/), we're returning to our instant-classic IMPAB rating system, which stands for:

 - Insta-cut
 - Meh
 - Playable
 - Auto-include
 - Build-around

Our goal is to build a cube that captures the vibe of the original Kamigawa block (low power environment, plenty of Spirits and Arcane spells, legends galore) while exploring the history and trivia of its coolest cards.

You can find our first episode [here](https://clockspinning.com/episode-1-white-champions-of-kamigawa/), where we also explain our IMPAB rating system in depth and introduce our cube, which we update with our ratings after every episode on [Cube Cobra](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk). We would also love for you to try [playtesting](https://cubecobra.com/cube/playtest/clock-spinning-chk) the cube, which gives us more insight into what's working in the cube and what might need a bit of tinkering.

If you have any thoughts to share about the cards we discuss on the show, cube philosophy, or just Magic in general, please get in touch!
