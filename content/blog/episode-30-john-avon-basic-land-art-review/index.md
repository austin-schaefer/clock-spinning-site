Clock Spinning is getting back to basics in today's episode with a review of our favorite pieces of basic land art from one of Magic's greatest and most prolific artists: John Avon. He's done fully 7% of all basic land art in the game, and in this episode we pay tribute to the master of mana by picking our favorite basic from each color and discussing why Avon's art can be so captivating, even on Magic's simplest cards.

Even more than usual, we recommend following along in the show notes for this one so you can see the lands as we discuss them! You can also tune in to this episode on YouTube (conveniently located at the top of this page) to see each basic on your screen as we cover it.
