Today’s episode features surprise appearances by not one but two of the quirkiest black commanders ever printed! This being Kamigawa, it also features arguably the worst single {B} discard spell ever printed, and finishes on an inexplicable demon that even the most dedicated combo connivers might struggle to break. Join us for part two of our Betrayers of Kamigawa Black review.

We’ll rate each card according to our not-yet-patented IMPAB rating system (for a full explanation of that, see [our first episode](https://clockspinning.com/episode-1-white-champions-of-kamigawa/):

 - Insta-cut
 - Meh
 - Playable
 - Auto-include
 - Build-around

Rather than build a traditional set cube, we’re building a curated Kamigawa block cube that distills what makes this unusual block so special. 

If you want to see how the cube is shaping up, check it out over on [Cube Cobra](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk). You’re welcome to just browse the list, or give it a test draft so we can see what real users make of this pile of quirky cards.

If you have any thoughts to share about the cards we discuss on the show, cube philosophy, or just Magic in general, please get in touch! You can email us at clockspinningpodcast@gmail.com, comment on [one of our Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/ClockSpinning), or check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning).'
