Today on Clock Spinning, we return to Kamigawa for our last full-color review of Betrayers for cube. In this episode, we're rating and reviewing at every green card in the set. Journey with Austin and Connor deep into Jukai Forest to find [ludicrously overcosted creatures](https://scryfall.com/card/bok/121/body-of-jukai), [more snakes](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Asnake+set%3Abok&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name) than any plane could ever need, and oodles of floating [green mana](https://scryfall.com/search?q=c%3Ag+set%3Abok+o%3A%7Bg%7D+-t%3Aarcane&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name). Our goal is to create a cube that captures some of the unique flavor, feel, and playstyles of OG Kamigawa block.

As always, we'll use our IMPAB rating system, which stands for:

 - Insta-cut
 - Meh
 - Playable
 - Auto-include
 - Build-around

You can find our first episode [here](https://clockspinning.com/episode-1-white-champions-of-kamigawa/), where we also explain our IMPAB rating system in depth and introduce our cube. Or, if you'd like to just pick up from the top of Betrayers, you can start with [episode 14](https://clockspinning.com/episode-14-bok-white-1/).

We also update the cube with our cuts ratings after every episode on [Cube Cobra](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/clock-spinning-chk), and we would love for you to try [playtesting](https://cubecobra.com/cube/playtest/clock-spinning-chk) it if you're interested! This really helps us see what's working in the cube and what could use a bit of adjustment (too many snekks?).

If you have any thoughts to share about the cards we discuss on the show, cube philosophy, or just Magic in general, please get in touch! You can email us at clockspinningpodcast@gmail.com, or find us over on the [MagicTCG](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/), and [EDH](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/) subreddits. You can also find every episode on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@clockspinning).
